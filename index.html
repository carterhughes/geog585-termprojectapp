                  <p>The title of my term project is the Courts of Montgomery County, Maryland (hosted as an Azure Static Web App).
                    The purpose of my term project is to create a web map that helps residents (or visitors) find sport courts
                    in Montgomery County, Maryland, according to their preferences and needs. The web map allows users to filter
                    courts by the type of sport they want to play such as basketball or tennis in addition to navigating their
                    locations across the county. Courts displayed in the web map provide important information for the user like
                    detailing the park in which the court is located, sports enabled by the court, the size of the court, and more.
                    Lastly, the web map features a basemap that contains valuable contextual information like parks, trails, and
                    transportation such that users can adequately plan and navigate to the court(s) of interest. The code for this
                    project is hosted publicly on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/carterhughes/geog585-termprojectapp">here</a>.</p>
